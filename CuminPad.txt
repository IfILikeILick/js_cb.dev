<h3>Rationale:</h3>
<p>

CuminBot is a really stupid and futile attempt to correct a modern misspelling so widespread as to be in danger of becoming orthodox.  And this guy despises orthodoxy, so...

<br/><br/>By way of (indirect) explanation, waaay back in 1993 a devotee of Bach's celebrated B minor mass was cautioned by his** ISP against using language "inappropriate to the Prodigy service."  Three decades later, this lonely script-jockey hopes Bach fans in rooms running CuminBot will be only momentarily perplexed by curious references to the non-existent movement "Come Sancto Spiritu."

<br/><br/>[[ **I checked the sex of the user with the great Peter van der Linden of "butt-ugly fish book" fame - to whom I owe this too-short anecdote. ]]

<br/><br/>Latin ain't my thing, but because no other English word begins with the first four letters of 'cummerbund' (it's a garment, folks) the initial spec for this bot was:-

<br/><br/>On startup, call cb.onMessage() setting a handler that:
<br/>--For all message words beginning with C followed by U followed by at least one M:
<br/>----If there is more than one M, leave 'cummerbund' alone and otherwise replace the U and all the Ms with O and a single M
<br/>----If there is exactly one M, leave entries in the CuminList alone but otherwise similarly flip the U to an O, and append an E if that M is also the last letter.

<br/><br/>The latest spec doesn't actually exist except in my head, but it's close to the above.  Where it's different, it is what the code does - except when the code does something I don't want.  When that happens, the spec is what I think the code ought to do instead.  More or less.

<br/><br/>The CuminList is named after the shortest word in it (it's a spice, folks).  Yes, I know you knew that.  The current CuminList is: cumber, cumbersome, cumbersomely, cumbersomeness, cumbrous, cumbrously, cumbrousness, cumin, cumquat, cumshaw, cumulate, cumulated, cumulates, cumulating, cumulative, cumulatively, cumuliform, cumulonimbus, cumulous, cumulus.

<br/><br/>Note that a variant spelling of cumin, viz 'cummin', IS replaced (by 'comin').  This problematic case is beyond my power to adjudicate; introduction of a toggle-switch for it is scheduled for version two.  But don't hold your breath.  Similarly, certain other awkward, mostly past-tense cases will be better-handled, based on what little user-feedback I expect to receive.  And 'cumshaw'** is up for review, too.  With love, -Mark (aka 'IfILikeILick'; feedback/thanks/jokes/etc to &lt;cumin AT cpt-ra.bid&gt; please or (bigger please), tip me happy).

<br/><br/>[[ **a loan word from Hokkien Chinese, apparently, and of which 'comshaw' is a variant spelling anyhow. ]]
